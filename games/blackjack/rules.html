                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                    Equally well known as Twenty-One, Blackjack is one of the most popular casino card games. The rules are simple, 
                    the play is thrilling, and there is opportunity for high strategy. For the expert player who mathematically plays 
                    a perfect game and is able to count cards, the odds are sometimes in that player's favor to win.

                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    While the popularity of Blackjack dates from World War I, its roots go back to the 1760s in France, where it is 
                    called Vingt-et-Un (French for 21). Today, Blackjack is the one card game that can be found in every American casino.

                        <p class="text-gray-300">
                            The standard 52-card pack is used, but in most casinos several decks of cards are shuffled together. 
                            The six-deck game (312 cards) is the most popular. A blank plastic card is placed toward the bottom 
                            to indicate when to reshuffle. When four or more decks are used, they are dealt from a shoe (a box 
                            that allows the dealer to remove cards one at a time).

                            Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

                            Before the deal begins, each player places a bet in the designated area. Minimum and maximum limits 
                            are established on the betting, and the general limits are from $2 to $500.

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                    When all players have placed their bets, the dealer gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise, 
                    and then one card face up to themselves. Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player, but the 
                    dealer takes the second card face down.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    Thus, each player except the dealer receives two cards face up, and the dealer receives one card face up and 
                    one card face down.

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                    If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving a count of 21 in 
                    two cards, this is a natural or "blackjack."

                            A player may continue taking cards until they either "stand" or "bust" (go over 21).

                            An ace with any other card is known as a "soft hand," as the ace can count as 1 or 11. For example, 
                            with a "soft 17" (ace and 6), the total can be 7 or 17.
