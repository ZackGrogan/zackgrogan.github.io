                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                    Pool is a popular cue sport played on a rectangular table covered with a cloth, where players use a cue stick to strike balls into pockets. The game is known for its strategic play and requires skill and precision.

                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    The objective of Pool is to score points by pocketing balls in a specific order, depending on the variation of the game being played.

                            A standard Pool table is 7 to 9 feet long and has six pockets. The game is played with 16 balls: one cue ball and 15 object balls.

                            Players aim to pocket their designated balls (stripes or solids) and then the 8-ball to win the game.

                            Points are scored by successfully pocketing balls. The player who pockets the 8-ball after all their designated balls wins the game.

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                    The game begins with a break shot, where the cue ball is struck from behind the head string to hit the racked balls. A legal break requires at least four object balls to hit a cushion or pocket an object ball.

                            Fouls occur when a player fails to hit their designated balls first, fails to hit any ball, or scratches the cue ball. Fouls result in the opponent getting ball-in-hand.
